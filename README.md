# Huffman-Algorithm

First of all, place all your text files you want to compress in the same folder as the compression code "Huffman.java", as well as all the classes.

Next, open the code, and modify line 84 of the code with the name of your text file. For example, "cats.txt". You also want to modify line 160 with the name of your text file.

Once you're done with all of that, you can run the code in terminal. 

The compressed, decompressed and huffman tree files will appear in the same folder with all your text files and the compression code.

You'll see that the file you wanted is compressed (you can check by "get info"), and that your decompressed file is approximately the same size as the original text file.
